## Installation

To set up the project, you need to install the required packages. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run Benchmarking**:
   Use `benchmark.py` to evaluate different models against the benchmark datasets.

   ```bash
   python botlogic/benchmark.py
   
2. **Data Retrieval**:
   Use `retriever.py` and `retriever_pipe.py` to retrieve data for your tasks.

   bash
   python botlogic/retriever.py
   ```

3. **Model Training**:
   Modify the scripts in `botlogic/ to train your models based on your requirements.

4. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Open the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for interactive experimentation and analysis.
